NOTE: We use effort-based-versioning

### [v0.1.0]

Several environment (Hanabi, Storm, Overcooked, Coin Game, MPE FacMac) API's updated to conform with the base API, new test added to ensure this happens for future environments. As this will change user interactions with some environments, have updated version to 0.1.0 to reflect the possible effort needed. Baseline scripts also updated to reflect this change.
